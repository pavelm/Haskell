{- | Finance.Quote.Yahoo

Finance.Quote.Yahoo is a module to obtain quote information from 
finance.yahoo.com, which delivers a csv file with data for various fields, 
which are documented at http:\/\/www.gummy-stuff.org\/Yahoo-data.htm.

The homepage for this module is 
http:\/\/www.b7j0c.org\/stuff\/haskell-yquote.html

The license for this module is at
http:\/\/www.b7j0c.org\/stuff\/license.txt

Since this uses Data.Time.Format, ghc-6.6.1 or greater is required.

Error reporting is somewhat of a mixed model in this module. Where strict
errors of data construction occur, these will be noted as fatal error()
signals, so the error can be noted and fixed. An example of this would be
putting the start and end data in the wrong order for the retrieval of
historical quotes or the creation of a malformed URI. On the other hand,
I continue to propogate Nothing() for networking issues as there may be 
external issues creating these errors for which one may want program 
execution to continue. My personal tendency is to fail early when 
possible and practical.


Exported functions:

getQuote, which takes a list of quote symbols (in the finance sense of 
\"symbol\" - YHOO,GOOG etc), a list of fields, and 
returns a Data.Map, where the keys are pairs (symbol,field) and 
values are the returned Strings. Upon any problem, Nothing is 
returned. I have not cast the data into stronger types than String since
Yahoo is inconsistent about what is returned in the csv. Fields often
contain punctuation, symbols, as well as numbers. So really, they are
Strings.

getHistoricalQuote, which takes a quote symbol, and two Data.Time.Calendar
Day types, one for the starting date to receive quote data, and one for the
end date. Yahoo does not let you choose the fields to see in historical
quotes, data is limited to price and volume information.

quoteRec - useful for debugging the quote URI to see if Yahoo is denying
the service.

Here is small complete program illustrating the use of this module

@
  module Main where
  import Finance\.Quote\.Yahoo
  import Data\.Time\.Calendar
  import Data\.Map
  quoteSymbolList = [\"YHOO\",\"^DJI\"] :: [QuoteSymbol]
  quoteFieldsList = [\"s\",\"l1\",\"c\"] :: [QuoteField]
  main = do
  q <- getQuote quoteSymbolList quoteFieldsList
  case q of
    Nothing -> error \"no map\"
    Just m -> case (Data.Map.lookup (\"YHOO\",\"l1\") m) of
                   Nothing -> print \"no match\"
                   Just a -> print a
  let startDate = Data.Time.Calendar.fromGregorian 2007 07 01
  let endDate = Data.Time.Calendar.fromGregorian 2007 07 03
  h <- getHistoricalQuote (head quoteSymbolList) startDate endDate Daily
  case h of
    Nothing -> error \"no historical\"
    Just l -> sequence $ Prelude.map print l
  return ()
